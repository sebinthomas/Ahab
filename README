AHAB

Description

Ahab is a project on Motion Gaming . Done with OpenCV , You are able to control a Paddle with the motion of your Hand (Or any Motion , the web cam is able to detect ! ) . It's done in VC++ and is rather very primitive in Design. 


NOTES
You need OpenCV installed and you need to change the location of the OpenCV libraries in the VC++ project in order to run.


ISSUES
Not at all Optimized , so the code lags and finaly hangs if you have a slow system.
